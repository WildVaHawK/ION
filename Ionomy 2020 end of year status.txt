The WIN project is a major player in supporting the ION coin from Wild's Depot members and the Ionomy community. This project has been kept [color=maroon][b]secret[/b][/color] according to the LAWS set-forth by the ionomy management team.  If you take a glance at this ION announcement thread, starting since the 1st of April the project has started to [b]ADVERTISE[/b] the WIN concept and has drawn a lot of [b]ATTENTION [/b]to the 2019 thru 2025 ION vision. The WIN project has accomplished a Test of Concept experiment using the IONsx and Atom assets. The research and development team has also produced a System Test report [color=red]uncovering the horrors found in the [b]2019 Ionomy ecosystem[/b][/color]. Just recently, the Wild's Depot members have identified [color=maroon]35 defects in the [b]IIP 6 design and implementation[/b][/color] of the next ION 2020 wallet product.

Here's a look at the changing project milestones that keep getting deleted with very nice possible [color=limegreen]rewards for [b]Q1 2020 [/b]for [b]NEW ION Masternode & Sharenode investors[/b][/color].

What is wrong with [color=blue][b]12 [/b]block reward split 3 ways  randomly to [b]ION members[/b] every minute [/color] ::)

@Mr. Suchmoon Could you [b]MERIT [/b]bitcon talk 09869 & 9877 to show what a PROFESSIONAL post is ... 

lol  Now the TROLLs are attempting to [b]REMOVE [/b]the key PROFESSIONAL posts from the thread  ::) I have good system of backing up my work effort on a daily basis to prevent lost of data in the ION RENOUNCEMENT thread.  ;D The system notifies me by generating an email to Mr. Onion and sending the exact text of the post being removed   ;D ;D [color=green][b]Mr. Welsh[/b][/color], can the system be modified to include the text reported by the reporter in the email? This would make it easier for the offending member to alter the post to [color=red]comply with all the [b]Bitcontalk RULES[/b][/color]  :)
